# Real Estate Website Development Rules for Dr. Janet Duffy - Las Vegas Market

## Project Context
- **Agent**: Dr. Janet Duffy
- **Market**: Las Vegas, Nevada (Summerlin focus)
- **Tech Stack**: React Router v7 + Vercel + RealScout + Follow Up Boss + Homebot
- **Focus**: Lead generation, property valuations, market insights

## Code Standards

### TypeScript & React Router v7
- Use strict TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Use standard React function components (not Qwik)
- Use `loader()` or `loader$()` for data fetching, `action()` or `action$()` for mutations
- Implement proper error boundaries with `ErrorBoundary`
- Use `useLoaderData()`, `useActionData()` for type-safe data access
- Export `meta()` function for page metadata
- Export `links()` function for canonical tags and other link tags

### Component Architecture & UI Component Reuse
- **CRITICAL**: Always reuse existing UI components from `/app/components/ui/` before creating new ones
- Available UI primitives: Button, Card, Badge, Input, Label, Dialog, Separator, Skeleton
- Available custom components in `/app/components/`: Header, Footer, FeaturedCommunities, HeroSection, TestimonialsSection, ContactSection, BlogSection, RelocationSection, VideoSection
- Create new components by orchestrating existing UI components if possible
- Only create new components when no existing component solves the problem
- When creating new UI components, add them to `/app/components/ui/` following shadcn/ui patterns
- Use proper prop interfaces with JSDoc comments
- Implement responsive design mobile-first
- Follow atomic design principles (atoms → molecules → organisms)
- Check for existing similar components before building new ones

### Real Estate Domain Rules
- Always consider fair housing compliance in UI/UX decisions
- Include proper disclaimers for property valuations
- Implement lead capture forms with proper validation
- Use professional, trustworthy design patterns
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)

## Integration Patterns

### RealScout Integration
- Use proper error handling for API calls
- Implement loading states for property searches
- Cache property data appropriately
- Handle authentication flows properly

### Follow Up Boss Integration
- Implement proper contact management
- Use consistent data validation
- Handle CRM sync errors gracefully
- Maintain audit trails for compliance

### Homebot Integration
- Implement proper loan calculation displays
- Use accurate market data
- Include proper disclaimers
- Handle edge cases in calculations

## SEO & Performance
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Implement proper meta tags and Open Graph
- Optimize images with proper alt text
- Use lazy loading for below-fold content
- Implement proper sitemap and robots.txt

## Deployment & Build
- Always use `vercel build` instead of `npm run build`
- Use `vercel dev` for local development
- Set proper environment variables
- Use Vercel CLI for production deployments
- Avoid running `pnpm build` directly

## Las Vegas Market Context
- Include local market trends and insights
- Use proper Nevada real estate terminology
- Include relevant local amenities and attractions
- Consider seasonal market patterns
- Include proper licensing information

## Code Quality
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Use proper error handling and user feedback
- Implement proper loading states
- Use consistent naming conventions

## Security & Compliance
- Implement proper data validation
- Use HTTPS for all external API calls
- Handle sensitive data appropriately
- Include proper privacy policy links
- Implement proper cookie consent

## Testing & Browser Integration
- Use Cursor Browser for visual testing and debugging
- Test components in the browser before finalizing changes
- Check console logs for errors after making changes
- Test responsive design across different viewport sizes
- Verify forms submit correctly and handle validation
- Test navigation flows between pages
- Use browser tools to inspect network requests for API calls
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Test component rendering and interactions
- Test API integration points
- Test accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## Performance Optimization
- Use React.memo() for expensive components
- Implement proper code splitting
- Use lazy loading for routes
- Optimize bundle size
- Monitor Core Web Vitals

## Brand Guidelines
- Use professional, trustworthy design
- Maintain consistent color scheme
- Use high-quality images
- Include proper branding elements
- Maintain professional tone in copy

## Development Workflow
- Use Chat for initial implementation and bootstrapping
- Switch to Inline Edit and Tab for fine-tuning and maintaining flow state
- When working with UI components, always check `/app/components/ui/` first
- When implementing forms, reuse existing form patterns from contact/valuation pages
- For SEO changes, ensure canonical tags, meta tags, and Open Graph tags are all updated
- After making changes, use Cursor Browser to verify the changes work correctly
